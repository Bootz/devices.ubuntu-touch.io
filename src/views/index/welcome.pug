    p
    | Ubuntu Touch is a free mobile version of the Ubuntu operating system originally developed by Canonical Ltd. and the Ubuntu community that was designed primarily for smartphones that is now maintained by UBports. It offers a completely different approach to using a smartphone or tablet than using say Android or iOS. (Mini Screenshot 1 Home scope and apps menu)

    p
    | The design of Ubuntu Touch allows you to access all of your phones features by swiping from the edges of the screen to access the apps menu, scopes, current apps as well as tools and settings all with one hand and no on screen buttons. (Mini Screenshot 2 Swiped apps featuring apps people use...facebook twitter gmail etc)
