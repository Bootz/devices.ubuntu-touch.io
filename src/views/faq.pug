          h1 Frequently asked questions
        h2 Will you keep Ubuntu Touch alive?
        p Yes! We will take over all devices and will continue delivering new features on some of the more recent ones. The older devices will be on life support and the actual work will happen in the non-legacy branch, but we will still provide critical security-updates and merge bug-fixes from the community. This way you will still be able to use your phone with Ubuntu Touch if you own one of the official devices, but the cool and shiny new features will probably only land in the non-legacy branch.
        p We are putting devices here because we don’t have any other choice. The official devices from BQ and Meizu have closed Android device trees. Because of this, we aren’t able to fix bugs in hardware enablement or add new features dependant on the kernel.
        h2 Which devices will be supported by the non-legacy branch?
        p This is not yet decided. Promising candidates are the Fairphone 2, Nexus 5, Oneplus One and Bq M10 tablet, but this may change in the future.
        h2 When will I be able to reflash my phone with the new images?
        p We're working as fast as we can to get the images out there.
