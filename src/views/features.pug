            | Ubuntu Touch is a mobile version of the Ubuntu operating system for mobile devices. However, unlike other 'flavors' of Ubuntu such as Mate, Mint and Gnome, it is more accurately an extract of parts of Ubuntu. It is adapted to run naturally in a mobile, touch-screen environment but is also capable of functioning as a desktop computer while in "desktop mode". This aforementioned converging of environments from device to device is where the term "Convergence" originates. You can find more technical details on our github page.
